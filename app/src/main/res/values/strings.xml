    <string name="acceptance_speech">Hey, look, man! Creating this app was a rollercoaster ride to say the least. I had my ups, I had my downs, I had moments when I just had to walk away from the laptops because regardless of what I did, nothing would work but I sticked it out, and what we have here is the end product of a lot of hard work and persistence. Real quick, I just want to thank God, my mom, TAs like Victoria, Bryant, Darnell, Jose(OG) and Yoki who helped me overcome some of those obstacles I mentioned earlier, and fellow classmates who encouraged me to continue when frustration started kicking in. In closing, if I would pass anything on, anything at all, it would be that you should never give up. If you need to take a break, take a break..if you want to take a quick nap and return to tackle your problem(s) with a fresh perspective, you do just that! \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tREMEMBER \nThere are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-Colin Powell</string>
